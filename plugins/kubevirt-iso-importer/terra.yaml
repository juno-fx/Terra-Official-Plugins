  Import ISO images into KubeVirt Virtual Machines using the Containerized Data Importer (CDI). This plugin simplifies 
  the process of creating VMs from ISO files, enabling users to easily set up and manage virtual machines within their 
  Kubernetes clusters.
  
  For now, this only supports URL downloads, but support for other sources will be added in the future. Such as 
  importing from existing Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs) or local file uploads.
