  Mount a location on the host node as a Persistent Volume in your Kubernetes cluster using the HostPath volume type.
  This plugin allows for operators to mount existing directories on the hosts into running Pods which means you can 
  reuse existing legacy tools such as Ansible. It is important to note that HostPath volumes are only local to the node, 
  so if you need access to a tool or library, you must ensure that all target nodes have this path available.
  
  **Warning:** Using HostPath volumes can pose security risks, as they allow Pods to access and modify files on the host node. 
  Ensure that you understand the implications and restrict access appropriately.
