description: >
  JupyterLab is the latest web-based interactive development environment for notebooks, code, and data. Its flexible interface allows users to configure and arrange workflows in data science, scientific computing, computational journalism, and machine learning. A modular design invites extensions to expand and enrich functionality. When creating your workload template, use an image compliant with Jupyter's docker-stacks, eg. https://quay.io/repository/jupyter/datascience-notebook.

  Keep in mind your data will NOT be persisted unless you add appropriate storage mounts for /home/
  The notebooks run as your project's user and inherit their UIDs. The notebooks assume the home directory is mounted at /home/<username>
