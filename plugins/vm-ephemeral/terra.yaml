  A generic ephemeral Virtual Machine (VM) compatible with KubeVirt, designed for temporary use 
  cases where persistent storage is not required. This VM can be quickly deployed and discarded, 
  making it ideal for testing, development, or short-term workloads. (This is currently in Alpha. Use at your own risk.)
