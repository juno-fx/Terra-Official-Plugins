## Community Repositories

If you have created your own repository for Terra plugins and you would like to get it approved as an official repository, 
please reach out to us via our community channels. We will review your repository and, if it meets our standards, we will 
add it to the list of official repositories. You can also open an issue on the Terra GitHub repository to request review of your repository.
