You can check the install logs and progress by clicking the Puzzle Piece icon in the top right of the Market.
That will take you to the "Sources and Installed" page.

From here, you can check the state of your install, get logs and much more.

## Custom Sources

You can add additional sources to the Terra Marketplace by clicking the "New Source" button in the top left of the page.
As long as the repository follows the same structure as the Terra-Official-Plugins, you can add it to your Orion Cluster.
