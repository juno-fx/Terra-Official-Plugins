  A single install bundle for both Kubevirt and our Generic Ephemeral VM plugins.
  
  KubeVirt technology addresses the needs of development teams that have 
  adopted or want to adopt Kubernetes but possess existing Virtual Machine-based 
  workloads that cannot be easily containerized. More specifically, the technology 
  provides a unified development platform where developers can build, modify, and 
  deploy applications residing in both Application Containers as well as Virtual Machines 
  in a common, shared environment. (This is currently in Alpha. Use at your own risk.)

  A generic ephemeral Virtual Machine (VM) compatible with KubeVirt, designed for temporary use 
  cases where persistent storage is not required. This VM can be quickly deployed and discarded, 
  making it ideal for testing, development, or short-term workloads. (This is currently in Alpha. Use at your own risk.)
